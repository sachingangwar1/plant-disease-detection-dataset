Plant Diseases Detection?

Detecting plant diseases is crucial for several reasons:

Agricultural Productivity: Early identification of diseases can prevent widespread outbreaks, ensuring the health and yield of crops.

Economic Impact: Minimizing crop losses due to diseases directly affects the economic stability of farmers and the agriculture industry.

Food Security: Protecting crops from diseases is essential to maintain a stable food supply for the growing global population.

Environmental Protection: Effective disease management reduces the need for chemical treatments, thus protecting the environment.


 SECOND PROJECT: handwritten digit recognition dataset
MNIST Digits - Classification Using SVM**

Objective We will develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. Thus, this is a 10-class classification problem.

Data Description For this problem, we use the MNIST data which is a large database of handwritten digits. The 'pixel values' of each digit (image) comprise the features, and the actual number between 0-9 is the label.

Since each image is of 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel forms a feature, there are 784 features. MNIST digit recognition is a well-studied problem in the ML community, and people have trained numerous models (Neural Networks, SVMs, boosted trees etc.) achieving error rates as low as 0.23% (i.e. accuracy = 99.77%, with a convolutional neural network).

Before the popularity of neural networks, though, models such as SVMs and boosted trees were the state-of-the-art in such problems.

We'll first explore the dataset a bit, prepare it (scale etc.) and then experiment with linear and non-linear SVMs with various hyperparameters.

We'll divide the analysis into the following parts:
